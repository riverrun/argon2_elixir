Argon2 password hashing library for Elixir.

[Argon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) is the official winner
of the [Password Hashing Competition](https://password-hashing.net/),
a several year project to identify a successor to Bcrypt / Pbkdf2 / Scrypt
password hashing methods.

## Installation

1.  Add `:argon2_elixir` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [
        {:argon2_elixir, "~> 3.0"}
      ]
    end
    ```

2.  Optional: during tests (and tests only), you may want to speed up the tests. If you have a `config/test.exs`, you can add:

    ```elixir
    config :argon2_elixir,
      t_cost: 1,
      m_cost: 8
    ```

## Configuration

Configure `argon2_elixir` - see the documentation for
[`Argon2.Stats`](https://hexdocs.pm/argon2_elixir/Argon2.Stats.html) for more details
